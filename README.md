This repository demonstrates a common error in C++: division by zero. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version.  The error occurs because the program attempts to divide the variable `x` by `y`, where `y` is 0. This results in undefined behavior, potentially causing a crash or producing unexpected results.  The solution involves adding a check to prevent division by zero.
